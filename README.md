# Text Data Extraction Sample Project

This project demonstrates my ability to extract clean, structured data from messy written text.

### Tasks Completed:
- Identified key information (names, emails, phone numbers)
- Cleaned invalid email formats (removed @@, #, and (at))
- Standardized phone numbers
- Extracted request types from unstructured text
- Classified priority levels (Normal vs Urgent)

### File Included:
- `extracted_support_requests.csv` — final cleaned and extracted dataset

This type of work is commonly required in customer support, admin assistance, CRM updates, data entry, and inbox management tasks.
